# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. Explain what a token is used for.

>- Token authentication requires users to obtain a computer-generated code (or token) before they're granted network entry. Token authentication is typically used in conjunction with password authentication for an added layer of security. This is what we refer to as two-factor authentication 

2. What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?

>-  Generally, OAuth provides to clients a "secure delegated access" to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials. Designed specifically to work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner. The third party then uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.

3. Describe how web servers work.

>- Simple process consists of 4 steps, they are: 

-   Obtaining the IP Address from domain name.
-   Browser requests the full URL
-   Web server responds to request
-   Browser displays the web page

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

>- In RESTful style programming, we should use HTTP methods as our building blocks. I'm a little confused though which methods match up to the classic CRUD methods. GET/Read and DELETE/Delete are obvious enough.
